## Roko's Conjecture: A Probabilistic Analysis of Expectation-Influenced Outcomes

### Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that explores the theoretical implications of consciousness on probabilistic outcomes, specifically within the context of a coin flip. The hypothesis, termed **"Roko's Conjecture,"** posits that if consciousness were to have an effect on reality, it would introduce additional states rather than influencing results directly.

### Contents
- **notebook.ipynb**: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation of classical and expectation-influenced coin flip simulations.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the project.

### Installation and Dependencies
To run the notebook, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
```

### Running the Notebook
1. Open the notebook using Jupyter:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebook.ipynb
   ```

2. Run all cells sequentially to generate results and visualizations.

### Explanation of the Code
- **Classical Coin Flip Simulation**: Simulates a fair coin flip with an equal probability of heads or tails.
- **Expectation-Influenced Model**: Introduces additional states where an observer's expectation is accounted for, leading to four possible outcomes.
- **Graphical Representation**: The results are plotted using Matplotlib for comparative analysis.

### Results
The analysis demonstrates that if expectation played a role in probability, it would effectively introduce new states, reducing the probability of a "desired" outcome from 50% to 25%.

### Future Work
- Expanding the model to incorporate quantum-based probability influences.
- Testing with real-world behavioral data.
